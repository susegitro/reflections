How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    to be honest, it didn't help me - i couldn't spot the spelling 
    mistake. saw to differences between the two files, though - 
    defintely easier with comparing command

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    will be easier to find bugs from later changes
    will be possible to re-use earlier solutions when appropriate
    in meeting new problems in the future

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Fill in your answer here

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google Docs notmade for tracking related documents
    Git for coding - so tracking changes in related documents 
    seems resonable

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: shows history overview, down with enter, quit qith q
    git diff: compares changes in detail between two versions
    caution: first version will be given _below_ next one
    fun fact: copy&paste of IDs works as marking -> shift+einfg
    that is: copy&paste in one step

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    previous state will be easily be getting back if needed...

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    when writing longer documents
    and for writing code in future, of course...
